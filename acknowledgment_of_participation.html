        <b><h2>Study “Distinguishing the role of vision and semantics in our mental and neural representation of visually-perceived objects”</h2></b>
        <br><br>
        We invite you to take part in a research study with the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (MPI). 
        Please read the following information carefully before you decide to engage in our study. 
        Your participation is voluntary and you may choose to withdraw from it anytime without negative consequences or having to state your reasons. 
        You can do so by simply returning the task, which will close the task. In case you choose to withdraw from participation, we will discard any gathered data. 
        The task session will close automatically after a timeout visible in the description of the task, in which case the task will be automatically returned, and no data will be recorded. 
        This study was approved by the ethics committee of the medical faculty of Leipzig University, Germany. (ethics number 092/22-ek)

        <b>Aims of the study</b>
        <br><br>
        We are interested in how the brain translates incoming sensory information into goal-directed behavior on the example of object perception. 
        This study aims to investigate how people represent objects. 
        We hope that this will improve our understanding of the mental representations that guide us through our world.

        <b>Benefit of this study</b>
        <br><br>
        This study is being conducted for the purpose of basic scientific research. 
        This means that participants will receive no direct benefit from it beyond reimbursement. 
        The findings obtained in the course of this study are expected to help improve our knowledge in the field of object recognition.
